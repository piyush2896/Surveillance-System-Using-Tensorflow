# Surveillance System Using Tensorflow
This repository is a combination of started code of Object detection using Tensorflow repository along with
email sender code.

## Usage
Make a gmail account and log on to it in browser before running the code.
And change the settings to allow access to less secure applications.
Make a file named ```sender_details.txt```. Contents of the file are as follows:
